## Energy Efficiency Toys
A set of toys for 10 year olds themed around energy efficiency and conservationism. Like Captain Planet but better
Similar: Recycle Hero (phone game which teaches recycling)

## Dependency Visualizer
A visualizer which depicts how intricately each team in a pipeline-driven company are coupled based on any of these metrics:
    - emails/messages exchanged between team members
    - number of distinct data sources used by members of both teams
    - JIRA tickets containing members of multiple teams
    - amount of inter-dependent code (idk how this is possible)
