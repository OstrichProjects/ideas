## Better Parental Controls
Kids have access to the entire internet and parental control tools are easy to bypass and have a lot of false positives. Machine learn / personally approve websites for kids under 10 and provide a hardware firewall to filter based on MAC address so little hacker kids can't circumvent it by looking shit up on google
